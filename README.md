# MongoDB

NoSQL(not just SQL) is an alternative to traditional relational databases, it has its own advantages:

* Handle large volumes of structured, semi-structured or unstructured data.
* Efficient, easy to scale out.
* Easy to expand schema.
* Easy for OO programming language to handle.

MongoDB is one of the best NoSQL database out there, if the application scenario does not require complex queries/lots of table joins, and requires flexible schema design, single table structure is enough...... then MongoDB is a very good choice.

This repository shows how to interact with MongoDB with Python, JavaScript(Node.js), Go.
